ADMButils Package Change Log

===========================
Version 2.0.1
01 Sep 2011 15:47:58
- added the functions read.fit(), orgpar(), orgfit().  Read.fit()
  read a fitted models object and returns a named list.  The org*
  functions take this named list and format it into org-mode format
  and place it on the clipboard so that model results can be
  summarized in e-macs orgmode buffers.

===========================
Version 2.0
29 Apr 2011 15:11:58
- all of the function have been "roxygeninzed" and are maintained in a
  single directory "~/fcts".
- an R-script "RoxygenizePkg.R" was created to document the packaging
  building process.
- no new functions or changes to existing functions where added in
  this build.

===========================
Build 0.2
Thu Nov 04 2010 14:21:43 
- dat_write and pin_write replaced with write.dat and write.pin
- write.dat contains a number of enhancements including the ability to
  include data frames and an improved header.  
- write.dat also allows the inclusion factors in dataframes, although
  they are converted to numeric values for ADMB, documentation is
  automatically included in dat file. 
- Other than the name change, write.pin and pin_write are essentailly
  the same functions.
- *.rd files for write.dat and write.pin were updated and improved
- TODO - change scaa.mcmc to 'admb.mcmc' and move to ADMButils.
  scaa.mcmc could be maintained in ADMBscaa as a wrapper for
  admb.mcmc, but admb.mcmc would be much more generic.  It could use
  and document Arni Magnusson's code to automaticlly write out
  variable names when mcmc iteration=1.  (see admb YaSnippet template).
